# Introduction

# Who Owns “The Internet”?

The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetwork or internet for short), cooperating with each other to exchange information using common standards. Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms, as shown in the figure.

Everything that you access online is located somewhere on the global internet. Social media sites, multi-player games, messaging centers that provide email, online courses — all of these internet destinations are connected to local networks that send and receive information through the internet.
